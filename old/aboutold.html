        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> We are a group of teenagers based in London aspiring to make a website to deliver all of the latest tech news to you, wether it be about 
            the newest iOS release or a new Samsung phone, we are on it. But what is our story? Well, we started construction on the 24th Jan 2025 and this is an 
            ongoing project to expand our knowledge of coding and website design. Our logo was designed by me and Rohan inside our school library one day after 
            making the idea, the sole purpose of this website is to get the latest tech news as fast as possible, no beating around the bush, no, just sole tech news, no interferences.
            Also, to set the record, we didnt use any website builders, just raw html, css and javascript. Click the "SOCIAL MEDIA" link inside the header at the top to view our youtube channel, be sure to subscribe!</p>

         <h2 class="Aboutush1" style="margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 4%;"> Badie Badie - Co-founder, Head Designer and editor of The Silicon</h2>
         <p>Badie Badie, I am 12 years old, and I live in London. I am the one responsible for this whole project— <i>Project Silicon</i>, as we called it. It was 
            basically my idea to start this whole thing, a spark of genius during a certain break time at school.
            I am also responsible for most of the logo design, the name, the website design, and all the small things that make this website feel more refined 
            (I basically did all the CSS).         
            My main tech consists of an M1 MacBook Pro—a great recommendation for anyone getting into the world of coding—an iPhone 14 Pro, 
            and an iPad 9th Generation, which I used for logo design, website design, and brainstorming ideas. I also use a Samsung WB150F camera for the wallpapers.
            I also am in charge of thesilicon youtube channel, I upload all the videos and basically run it. I also make all the wallpapers, thumbnails, logos and channel banners because I have lots of knowledge in UI/UX design
            and I primarily use canva and figma for that.
            
            I speak Kurdish and English fluently and am currently learning French and German in my studies. </p>

            <h2 class="Aboutush1" style="margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 4%;"> Charles Vompiris - Editor of The Silicon and Head of Content</h2>
            <p> Hi, I am Charles, and I am 13 years old. I am the main writer and editor for The Silicon. I was recruited to
                 the team one day after its founding, so you couldn’t call me a co-founder, but I have been here from the start.
                I don’t have any coding experience, but I have a passion for writing. I use an iPad Air 5 with a Logitech 
                Combo Touch keyboard for all my writing and editing work. I am also responsible for many of the wallpaper 
                images, as I travel a lot, and my passion is trains and planes. I speak English fluently and am currently learning Greek, German, and French in my studies.
            </p>
