        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> We are a group of teenagers based in London aspiring to make a website to deliver all of the latest tech news to you, wether it be about 
            the newest iOS release or a new Samsung phone, we are on it. But what is our story? Well, we started construction on the 24th Jan 2025 and this is an 
            ongoing project to expand our knowledge of coding and website design. Our logo was designed by me and Rohan inside our school library one day after 
            making the idea, the sole purpose of this website is to get the latest tech news as fast as possible, no beating around the bush, no, just sole tech news, no interferences.
            Also, to set the record, we didnt use any website builders, just raw html, css and javascript. </p>
