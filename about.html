        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>  <p>
            <p> How were we created you ask? well, it all started in 2024, where I, Badie Badie, learned how to code some basic HTML and CSS after seeing Rohan Kharel (read about him below) code a whole website fr our geoggrpahy presentation (was I jealous, yes, did I learn how to code, also yes) . I then decided to make a website about tech news and I asked my friends, Rohan Kharel and Charles Vompiris to join me in this journey. Me and Rohan then started to code the website on the 27th January 2025 and we are now here. If you are seeing this that means we made it and that our operation was sucess! </p>.
         <br> 
         <h2 class="Aboutush1"> Badie Badie - Co-founder, Head Designer and editor of The Silicon</h2>
         <p> Yes that is my name, Badie Badie, I am from Kurdistan in Iraq and I am basically the founder of this website, I mean, it was my idea. I am 12 years old and turning 13 in 2025. I am the one who also designed the beautiful logo of ours while sitting in a library at my school on an iPad. I also am in charge of most of the main design features of this website. I have a hobby that no one really knows about and that is solving Rubiks Cubes, I average around 12-18 seconds on a good solve, I use CFOP method and I currently use a Tornado V3 Pioneer edition (I ordered the flagship but recieved a pioneer üôÉ) I am also what one may call a geography nerd but yeah. I speak 4 languages, English, french, German and Kurdish but I can read and write Arabic even though I dont understand it. My favourite emoji has to be the upside down smiley face one becuase it is something unique. üôÉ</pr>    
            <br>
            <p> So, what tech do I use, for my main computer I use a late 2020 M1 Macbook Pro but if this website gets enough money I am planning on getting a M3 Macbook Pro, I also use, wait for it, yes, the Apple Magic Mouse, contrary to what people say, it is actually a good mouse to use and the ergonomics aren't actually a problem for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. For my phone I have a iPhone 14 Pro in space black but I am considering the iphone SE 4 if it does come out as I really do want apple intelligence. I also wear an Apple Watch Series 9 in space black (see the black theme going on here) and it is something I couldnt imagine my life without... For the iPad, I have a iPad 9th Gen that my school gave me free of charge (lucky no?) and I use a random Chinese stylus that gets the job done and is what designed the logo for this website. And, for a take back to the past, I use the SAMSUNG WB150F Camera, I find that it is good enough for all my photogrpahy even though the camera was manufactured before I was born. My desk is the ikea micke with the magnetic board thing at the top. I have decorated the desk with LEDS and old apple boxes such as the ones from the iPhone 5. </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="Aboutush1">Rohan Kharel - Co-founder, Lead Developer and editor of The Silicon</h2> 
            <p>Rohan Kharel, lead coder and also a co-founder, I am the one who actually knows what they are doing here and doesnt send corrupted SVG files of the logo (thats you Badie). I am 13 years old and turn 14 this year. I am the one resposible for most of the <i> cool </i> stuff in this website, not to brag, I bought the domain (with mine and Badie's money) üôä and I have a server at home because why not. I am basically the only person on the planet who actually uses Arch Linux and enjoys it :) I use a Google Pixel 8 with a random black silicon case and it is good but I would rather have an iPhone. For the laptop I use a lenovo yoga slim 7i and my hobby is basically doing sketchy stuff with computers, like turing them into servers or getting MacOS on my windows computer hehe.</p> 
            <br> 
            <h2 class="Aboutush1"> Charles Vompiris - Editor of The Silicon </h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Charles and I actually typed this myself because I am actually bothered unlike Rohan.  In my daily life, I use a google pixel 8 (just like Rohan) with the caseology NanoPop, a brilliant combination of sleek design and protection. For my education I use an iPad Air 5 with the Logitech Folio Touch Keyboard case with an Apple Pencil 2nd Gen that I got for ¬£30 on ebay (good deal huh?), great for all my school work. I also have a DELL i7 Pc mostly to play Microsoft Flight Simulator. </p>
            <p> I absolutely love Trains and Planes and I really like music, no, not all this modern music, I like to play the cello and piano to go on my more classical side üòÉ. I have a cheeky pet cat called Gingerbread who seems to have the hobby of keybaord-stepping (the official term for stepping on my keyboard when I am trying to do something) </p>
