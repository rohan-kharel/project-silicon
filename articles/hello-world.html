        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p><i>Published Sat 1 Feb 2025 | Written by the team</i></p>

<p> Hello world </p>
<p>Hello World! Hello world is a phrase that may hold special meaning to some of us, as this is usually the first command learnt when learning how to code, whether that be learning html, python or java I am sure there are people who feel that the phrase <i> Hello, World!</i> Has sentimental value to them. This is the first publication of the silicon and we are proud to say that our Project succeeded!</p>

<p>From the whole team: we would just like to say thank you to all who are embarking with us on this 
Venture for us to become one of the largest tech news outlets in the world. </p>

 <p>Be sure to discover the other sections on our website such as the <i> about </i> section, the really cool wallpapers that can be used on any device and there is sure to be something for everyoneâ€™s taste! Now you may be wondering, why <i> thesilicon </i>. Well, we chose this name as it reflects what we do, as it is a reference to companies such as nvidia and Apple using <i> silicon </i> in their chips, see what we did there. We hope to <i> conduct </i> (see what I did there? Like conduct, as in conducting electricty?) inspiration through our readers to make them feel like they are in the know about all of the latest tech news, articles will be published around twice a day so you will be able to read something new every day to add that sense of just calming down, relaxing and reading some tech news to end (or start) your day! We would also like to ask you to check out our youtube channel at @thesiliconofficial where you will be able to see some of the articles in video format, exclusive clips, tutorials and more! </p>

<p>If you are wondering how we made all of this, carry on reading: </p>

<p>We primarily used five main apps: WhatsApp, GitHub, Virtual Studio Code, Google Docs and Freeform. </p>

<p>WhatsApp: sort of explanatory, we used whatsapp to be able to communicate within the group, ask if ideas were good, share inspiration and call each other for long work sessions.</p>

<p>GitHhub: I dont want to bore you with github, this is basically all the <i> technicalities </i> where we published all the changes while working and whatnot.</p>

<p>VS Code: VS Code was the primary coding software used to make this website, a great tool as it blends functionality with a beautiful UI with lots of customisation, we used the Live Share extension for collaborating on work, and also the Five Server extension for viewing any changes made.</p>

<p>Google Docs: For collaboration on writing articles (this very article is being written on Google Docs right now!) Google Docs also blends functionality with a good UI (however we would love if there was a dark mode!)</p>

<p>Freeform: Logo was designed here and also brainstorming for layout ideas and all the rest of getting ideas, very good to use on our iPads to collaborate.</p>


<p>You may notice that no UI designer or website builder was mentioned, this is because we wanted to code this website raw, from the ground up to expand our coding knowledge and be ready to make more projects in the future. However, if we <i> could </i> restart we would probably use Figma to design everything first and then get on with coding because designing things was really just trial and error like getting the correct font sizes was a nightmare! </p>
